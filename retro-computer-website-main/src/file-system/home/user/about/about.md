# About Me

My name is Sai Ganesh Bhaskar. I'm a Software Engineer currently working at Embedur, where I'm exploring the fascinating world of AI and Large Language Models.

Software Engineer | AI & LLM Explorer | Learning RAG & Automation | Networking & Systems Tinkerer | Mentoring Teams (and occasionally pretending to be wise 😅)

I'm passionate about learning RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and automation technologies, while also tinkering with networking and systems. I enjoy mentoring teams and sharing knowledge with others.
